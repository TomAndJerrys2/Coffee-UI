# Coffee Emulator Front-End

This front end is built with the intention of showing my skills in various web technologies.
For this project, this combines a fully functional and interactive space in ElectronJS + AngularJS
for dynamic containers and an interactive user-experience. I also used Bootstap alongside SCSS to
beautify the html and even add built in library animations

Note: This links to the main Coffee Emulator which is the engine built in C++/x86 Assembly
